This is a short project of the provided dataset and the ways to do it. 
Template code is provided in the Dataset with ML.ipynb notebook file. You will also be required to use the included Dataset with ML.py Python file and the netflix.csv dataset and 
quaddata file to complete your work. While some code has already been implemented to get you started, you will need to implement additional functionality when requested to 
successfully complete the project. Note that the code included in Dataset with ML.py is meant to be used out-of-the-box and not intended for students to manipulate. The Dataset 
use there is extracted from "www.kaggle.com â€“ Kaggle is one of the main websites for datasets used for ML",
    "https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/ ",
    "https://opendata.socrata.com/",
    But at first we neeed to install the following:
    Download the jupyter notebook  from here and extract it from the command prompt 

And Now to install it go to:
https://jupyter.org/install

After installation go to your jupyter notebook and run the command in command prompt as directed there.
And then install the anaconda file here to get started 
https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/
Then after this is done you need to import Numpy,pandas in command prompt to run the dataset
